# Phonebook Demo Backend
 Hey, It's a Phonebook demo project.
 
## Installation

In the package manager console, select 'DataAccess' layer as a default project and then run:

### `update-database`

Your database will be installed After this command finished.

If you have an issue while running this command, please check out connectionString in the 'PhonebookDbContext.cs' file.\
Or google it with the error message :)

## If you want to add migration

In the package manager console, select 'DataAccess' layer as a default project again and then run:

### `add-migration foo`

Best,
Sefa
